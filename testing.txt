Sessions:



Note that single users can have one or more authentications.  
New users are created when an authentication is created when
an authentication couldn't be found with the current uid/provider combo

Upon sign out, 
the auth.token and auth.secret are nil'd out. 

Omniauth failures:
- auth hash nil iphone
- auth hash nil browser

Omniauth success:
- already signed in new authentication (make sure user has the new provider in the database) for iphone
- already signed in new authentication (make sure user has the new provider in the database) for browser
** the add_provider method in user.rb will either:
    1) update the credentials in an existing authentication row, or 
    2) call find_or_create to create an authentication row

- not signed in authentication. test find_or_create.  So two cases here, one 
   - where the authentication is a first, and 
   - one where the authentication is an old one. (**ensure that a new row isn't created - Authorization.find_by_provider_and_uid should find an existing
     user with an authentication of this provider and uid, and return the authorization object)
* in both cases, ensure that the token and secret are filled in

- sign out of all

- sign out of particular service
