Delete some new squeaks:
Squeak.where("id > 35").each {|s| s.delete }; nil

Where query:
s = Squeak.where(["expires > ? AND latitude < ? AND latitude > ? AND longitude < ? AND longitude > ?",DateTime.now.utc - 1,42,38,-80,-77])

Like query:
Squeak.where(["text like ?", "%2012\-07\-12 22\:04\:50 \-0400%"])
Squeak.where(["text like ?","%Auto%"]).first(200).each {|s| s.delete}; nil

Iterate:
Squeak.all.each {|s| puts "#{s.id} #{s.text} #{s.created_at} #{s.expires}" }; nil


** need a command to archive squeaks older than 24 hours old. where to put them?
I'll need a place with an identical user database table as well. 

can I just make a squeak_archive table and make two updates upon squeak creation. then every so often, I can delete out of the squeak table. The alternative is to periodically (during non-peak hours) query the database and copy the squeaks out and remove them from the 'live' table.
